What is Javascript ?

Javascript is  a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages

HTML - is a markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to web content

CSS - is a language of style rules that we used to apply styling to our HTML content

Javascript - is scripting langauge that enables you to create dynamically updating content

1. Syntax Parser
------------------
A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its syntax is valid

2. Lexical Environment
-----------------------
Where something sits physically in the code you write

3.Execution context
--------------------
A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.

for .e.g. There are lots of lexical environments. 
          Which one is currently running is managed by execution context.

Name/ Value pairs
-----------------
A name which maps to a unique value

Object
---------
A collection os name value pairs

The Global environment and Global Object
-----------------------------------------
When ever code is run in javascript it runs inside the execution context

1. Global execution context ( base)
2. Local Execution context

Execution Context ( Javscript engine creates these two things for us)
----------------- 
1. Global Object 
2. this ( variable)

Global - Means which is not inside the function 
local - Means is inside the function

var - helps you to declare your variable in javascript (ES5)

function - is block of code

Hoisting
----------------------------------------------

1. Read variabels and functions and add default value for variables 
2. Code execution

Hoisting
----------
1. Javascript engine will read your variables and functions and it adds 
   memeory space for your varibales and functions

2. variables will be added to memory and will be assigned a deafult value called 'undefined'

3. function will be added to memory completely ( entire function)

undefined - special value in javascript, whch takes up a memory space

Note : Never assign undefined to a variable, because it is difficult to 
       find whether the value is "undefined" or javascript engine sets it up
